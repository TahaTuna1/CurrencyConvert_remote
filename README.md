As of 18/04/2023, here's what I call, the Alpha phase. Since this app is meant to be a portfolio piece/Personal use project, I don't intend to complete it 100%. However, I will continue to add some basic missing features, which can be seen below.

Here are some of the missing features: 
- Can't change 2nd, 3rd, or 4th currency. Can't change their values either.
- The API is rather limited in terms of currencies. Can easily upgrade to the 'premium' version which even has crypto. The project uses FreecurrencyAPI.
- Default currencies don't save to user preferences.
- Currency change 'triangles' don't do anything. The main currency can be changed by clicking the text below the main currency amount.
- No other themes yet.
- Network calls made to the API are only made once per hour. (More frequent refreshes can be made into a premium feature?)
